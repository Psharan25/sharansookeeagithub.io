          <h4>Today's gyms have something for everyone, and you can find people of all ages there at any given time. But the gym has evolved a lot over the years and, in fact, centuries. What is now about running, pumping iron, and getting fit used to be about survival.
  
            Way back in the day, fitness wasn't really a choice; hunters and gatherers had to be in shape in order to survive. Once our civilization's lifestyle changed over to farming, our daily activities drastically changed. Complex moves such as jumping, crawling, and climbing weren't performed as often. So, things had to change, but it took quite some time to develop the gyms we know today.</h4>
